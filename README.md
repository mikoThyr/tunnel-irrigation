# Automation for watering the garden plants

## Description

*Automated process for watering garden plants at a particular time or if the soil humidity is too low. The device can work in two modes: the first is "normal," where the WiFi connection can be set up to gather data on the server, and the second is "eco," which can be used to decrease power consumption.*\n
*The system requires an external tank for watering plants. The water level can be controlled automatically and filled by a pump (an order is sent by RF433). The temperature is also checked, as it could cause thermal shock for plants if it will be too cold.*
*Due to the louder noise of the pumps, they can be turned off during the night.*\n
*Users can configure the upper and lower levels of humidity at which watering will start and stop, as well as the temperature of the water in the tank.*
